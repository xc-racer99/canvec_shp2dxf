406,406,680,Cloud,The coverage is under clouds
406,406,681,Shadow,The coverage is shadowed
407,407,682,Shrubland,"Predominantly woody vegetation of relatively low height (generally 2 metres Â±). May include grass or grassland, wetlands with woody vegetation, regenerating forest"
409,409,683,Shrub Tall,"At least 20% ground cover which is at least one-third shrub. Average shrub height greater than or equal to 2 m. In the North, moist to wet erect tall shrub > 40 cm forming more than 25% of the vegetated cover, consisting mainly of dwarf birch (Betula), willow (Salix) and / or alder (Alnus). Remaining cover consists of graminoids, lichen and may contain < 10% prostrate dwarf shrubs and bare soil."
407,407,684,Shrub Low,"At least 20% ground cover which is at least one-third shrub. Average shrub height is less than 2 m.
